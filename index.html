            A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than
            researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale
            crater for more than eight years, and while early observations
            suggested the entire crater may once have been filled with water, a
            new analysis implies that it just had a series of ponds instead.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a
            measure called the chemical index of alteration to determine how
            rocks were weathered over time. Joseph Michalski at the University
            of Hong Kong and his colleagues have suggested that because this
            measure was developed for use on Earth, it may not be valid in the
            extreme Martian climate.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds that
            are expected to change based on different types of weathering over
            time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity examined
            did interact with water at some point in their past, but more are
            likely to have formed outside of the water.

            “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers
            that are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in a lake] are the lower
            few metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the
            fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per
            cent.”
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of sediments in the
            crater, suggesting the lake was not nearly as deep or extensive as
            we thought. “There was likely a small lake or more likely a series
            of small lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow
            ponds,” says Michalski.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so
            Michalski says that they may have formed out of ash from volcanic
            eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up. Observations
            by other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments were
            deposited by wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.
